**\*GitHub users only rn.**

In my last blog update post, I [listed some plans](/blog/how-my-site-works#plans-for-the-future) for features I wanted to add to my site and blog, including  
- blog post reactions and comments
- better content management, and
- better image hosting

I've added these in!  
This post will give some basic details about how and why I did each of these things, from most to least interesting.

## Blog reactions and comments

My blog posts have comments and reactions now! They're down at the bottom of each post.

**Why?**  
I'm hoping my blog will eventually have some blend of technical content and opinion-y content. So I'm hoping comments will facilitate Q&A for technical content, and give space for broader discussions around opinion-y content. I don't anticipate much activity, but I want to nurture what I can!

**How?**  
[Giscus!](https://giscus.app/). This little tool lets you associate [GitHub Discussion Threads](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions) in your repository with pages on your website. 

Integration is simple. Giscus is a GitHub App so adding it to a repo is trivial. Once it's added, you can integrate it to a Docusaurus site with the [`@giscus/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@giscus/react) npm package. This gives you a little HTML tag that you can tell Docusaurus to attach to every Blog page.

I looked at these tutorials for help:
- [Daniel Farlow - How to add a comments section to doc pages and blog entries using giscus](https://dwf.dev/blog/2022/10/27/2022/giscus-comments)
- [m19v - How to add Giscus comments to Docusaurus](https://dev.to/m19v/how-to-add-giscus-comments-to-docusaurus-439h)

Giscus only supports comments for registered GitHub users right now. GitHub accounts are free and easy to make, but I'd probably enable anonymous comments [if they ever add support](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/issues/65).

## Image hosting

I'm serving images from a personal cloud storage bucket, via a custom subdomain (`assets.keldev.net/[image]`).

**Why?**  
Usually websites like mine just use something like [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/) or [imgur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imgur) for images, or just store images in their repo directly. Services like this work fine!

The biggest thing I get out of my setup is the ability to serve images over that custom subdomain, with more control over what the URL ends up being. So my image links end up looking like https://assets.keldev.net/test-flower.jpg instead of https://ibb.co/rRhGd8gH. I've also got the same amount of control over my image files that I've got with everything else in my personal storage. I can perma-delete or replace them, and re-download the original files whenever. I'm already paying for file storage with this service, and this solution didn't add any other costs.

<a class="zoomable" href="https://assets.keldev.net/test-flower.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Test image of an overexposed peony bud with some ants on it" class="img_ev3q" src="https://assets.keldev.net/test-flower.jpg"/></a>
> Here's that test flower image, for the curious.

**How?**  
My solution comes directly from the [Backblaze B2 docs](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-deliver-public-backblaze-b2-content-through-cloudflare-cdn)!  
I followed the instructions here pretty much exactly. This involved setting up a public B2 bucket (which is trivial once you're using B2), and setting my domain up with Cloudflare (which was fairly straightforward).


## Content management

My site is now split across two repos. [iamkeldev.github.io](https://github.com/IAmKelDev/iamkeldev.github.io) holds everything _except_ for the actual contents of my Blog posts, and [keldev-blog-drafts](https://github.com/IAmKelDev/keldev-blog-drafts) holds Blog post contents.

**Why?**  
This honestly doesn't do much. The site is just _slightly_ more modular, [concerns are _slightly_ more separated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). Edit history for the "main" site is no longer tied up with edit history for my blog post drafts. I can do all kinds of messy edits to each repo individually, and the messiness won't overlap much.

**How?**  
`keldev-blog-drafts` is mounted as a [Git Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), so that its contents go into the `blog/` directory. This is a very basic Git Submodule use case.
